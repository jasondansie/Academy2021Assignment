A few things I would implement would be:

levels - I would use the same obsticles but make them rotate faster

paralax backgrounds - mostly for show but also a way to make each level different in apperance.

High score - add a high score at top right, make a file where it's saved that way when they come back it will be there for them to try and beat.

High score animation and sound - Something like in bejeweld a voice saying "A new high score" and some sort of prticle effect appering on the screen. Got to reward the player and keep them coming back

Leaderboard - This may be ambisous but would find a way to upload high score to a server database so the player can play against friends.

Bugs/Issues:

Every thing works as per the instructions. I do have an issue with spawning the next obsticle. if you change to the comment out code under the collision section for the colorswitcher. it spwans correctly at the top but uses the first spawned rotationpoint.
So I did not have time to figure out how to fix this last issue. I left the color switcher spawning after you collect it to show how it would all work.
